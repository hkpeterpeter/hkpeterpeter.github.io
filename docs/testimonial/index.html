Peter has been extremely generous in giving his time for the project and for the students. Very often,
SIGHT teams meet in the evenings and weekends for hours. I understand that his involvement with SIGHT is
outside his university duty, and yet, the commitment and professionalism that Peter has shown are far beyond one
would expect from a volunteer. Peter cares about students and their education. I am grateful that Peter believes
in the vision of SIGHT and partners with us  to transform students into creative and socially responsible leaders.
Peter is a great asset of HKUST, and I am sure that he has already and is still making tremendous contribution
for your department.

I rank HackUST as one of the best events at UST that show cases the innovative, can-do spirit of HKUST!
It largely outranked many of the events we professors organize.
