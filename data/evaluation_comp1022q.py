"He explained the lab very clearly. And he raised my interest in doing the lab. For example, in the last lab, he showed a lot of music tracks, like Let it go, Animal Crossing song. It made the lab more interesting. The pre recorded video by Peter is really good, very detailed and easy to follow helped me a lot in this course His presentation is easy to listen as well",
"Again, one of the best TAs during my study in HKUST. He speaks clearly and loudly, such that people would hardly fall asleep during the lab (haha). Also, a brand new way of asking questions online (via sli.do) encourages me to ask more questions regarding the lab rather than raising hands in front of 60+ people in the lab.",
"He really arouse my interest in doing and going to the lab even if it was a 9am class. He tells jokes and it was quite fun.

"He needs to stop making inappropriate jokes in class. It wasn't funny nor helpful towards the lab sessions.",
"Please speak faster",
