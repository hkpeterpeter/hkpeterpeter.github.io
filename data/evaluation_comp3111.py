"""For the project demo, he kept distracting us while we were doing and figuring out the procedures of the demo,
which may seem interacting with students to him, but distracting and annoying to us""",
"The attitude of teaching could be better. (1999)",
"Should be more information for the materials",
"Re-align the mismatch between the posted grading criteria and the actual grading scenario",
"Seems like he favors students who speak Cantonese...",
"He should at least have some knowledge about the course material",

"Perhaps be more friendly and approachable",
"can be a bit more friendly to students and he will be a better ta if he look a bit more carefully to our email. But he is helpful overall",
