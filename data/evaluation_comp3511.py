"""Peter provided quick and effective response in replying emails. He also conducted interactive and "non-boring" tutorials like
interesting ways to memorise some concepts.
""",
"""The TAs are all very nice and helpful, especially TA Peter, he always explains concepts very clearly with animations in the tutorials.
He also made a website for each students to check their assignment scores, and he is often patient and kind to answering student's
questions through emails""",
"""I really appreciate Peter for putting extra effort in the lab session such that students can understand the topic better. The animations
and examples indeed help me a lot in understanding how the things work.""",
"""Peter is very clear and fun to hear from. His lab sessions are the sessions that i looked most forward to. To the extent that I picked
up the courage to do this survey only to upvote him. I can tell that he really wants to explain for the purpose of delivering actual
knowledge to students. Other TAs, not so much.""",  
"""Peter teaches very well in tutorial sessions and is able to explain lots of difficult and confusing concepts in simple words or
metaphors. He also explain the rationale behind various programming assignments very detailed so that I found it meaningful and
enjoyable. He is one of the best TA I have seen in UST.""",
"""Peter seems to be extremely passionate towards teaching. His explanations are clear and clears up a lot of confusion towards some
of the more complicated concepts. Also does ACTUAL demo instead of only reading the slides, which is a rare trait. They say it is
way easier to look at the bad than the good. I tried my best to write as many good things that I spotted. Thank you Peter!!!!""",
"""The TA is very enthusiastic and he is able to explain concepts in lessons very well. He also gave very clear instructions for the programming assignments. In particular, he wrote a simple website for PA1 that included a code editor together with videos to explain the code, which is very impressive. I think it's rare to find TAs with such passion in HKUST.""",
"""Mr Chung will prepare extra project materials in order to provide more help to all the students. The materials are very useful and
well organized. Thanks to Peter, I have a better understanding to my project assignment and he saves me a lot time!""",
"""Nice examples and presentations, also explain other topics like Docker although it is out of scope.""",

"""Peter is very clear in his teaching, he's also really funny so he keeps us all engaged. He also responds very quickly to any questions
and he is very detailed and clear is his explanations so there's no confusion""",
  """Clearly illustrate the concept, teaching base on the student's difficulties. Try to understand learning obstacle from student's
perspective, and give some suggestion""",
  """Really encourages the spirit of education. Instead of being able to just regurgitate knowledge, peter encourages a deeper
understanding among us students.
